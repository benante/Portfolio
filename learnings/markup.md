```<header>``` includes a ```<nav>``` element that contains navigation links. 

```<main>``` on the other hand is divided by different ```<section>``` elements which also includes ```<h1>``` and ```h2``` headings, ```<p>``` paragraphs, and ```<li>``` list elements 
## 2. Ensure a web page is readable for screen readers
To ensure the web page is readable for screen readers, the following practices have been implemented:

ARIA attributes have been used to provide additional accessibility information. For instance ```<aria-label>``` has been used to provide labels for navigation links and buttons.

Images have been provided with appropriate alternative text using the ```<alt>``` attribute, allowing screen readers to describe the images to visually impaired users.

The website was run through Accessibility Checker and passed the test.

## 3. Ensure our UI has sufficient colour contrast so that everyone can perceive it comfortably

## 4. Use various tools to check that our website meets accessibility criteria

## 5. Use CSS media queries to ensure our content is always presented effectively on screens of different sizes

## 6. Demonstrate a mobile-first approach to building a website

## 7. Use CSS variables to apply repeated colours to HTML elements

## 8. Use CSS Flexbox to style children in a single-direction layout (ie a row or a column)

## 9. Use CSS Grid to style children in two-direction layout

## 10. Ensure our Git commit history tells a coherent story

## 11. Use the appropriate input types in HTML forms for gathering different types of information
