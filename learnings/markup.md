## 1. Structure a site using semantic HTML to aid accessibility
Different semantic elements were used aid accessibility:

```<header>``` includes a ```<nav>``` element that contains navigation links. 

```<main>``` on the other hand is divided by different ```<section>``` elements which also includes ```<h1>``` and ```h2``` headings, ```<p>``` paragraphs, and ```<li>``` list elements 
## 2. Ensure a web page is readable for screen readers
To ensure the web page is readable for screen readers, the following practices have been implemented:

ARIA attributes have been used to provide additional accessibility information. For instance ```<aria-label>``` has been used to provide labels for navigation links and buttons.

Images have been provided with appropriate alternative text using the ```<alt>``` attribute, allowing screen readers to describe the images to visually impaired users.

The website was run through Accessibility Checker and passed the test.

## 3. Ensure our UI has sufficient colour contrast so that everyone can perceive it comfortably

## 4. Use various tools to check that our website meets accessibility criteria

## 5. Use CSS media queries to ensure our content is always presented effectively on screens of different sizes
Mobile and tablet screen have the same properties here, the layout shows a significant change only when on desktop size

## 6. Demonstrate a mobile-first approach to building a website
After an initial quick draft on Figma the website was build for mobiles first, then media queries were added for responsiveness for larger screens

## 7. Use CSS variables to apply repeated colours to HTML elements
